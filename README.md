## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

The Sonr Go Wallet SDK follows a modular architecture, comprising the following core components:

1. **`github.com/sonr-io/coins`**: Implements transaction creation and signing for each blockchain.
2. **`github.com/sonr-io/crypto`**: Manages general cryptographic operations and signature algorithms.
3. **`github.com/sonr-io/crypto/util`**: Provides helper utilities for common operations.

This structure allows for easy integration and extension of new blockchains.

## üì¶ Installation

To install the Sonr Go Wallet SDK, ensure you have Go 1.22+ installed, then run:

```shell
# Set up Go environment for private repositories
export GOPRIVATE=git.sonr.io
export GONOPROXY=git.sonr.io
export GONOSUMDB=git.sonr.io

# Install SDK components
go get -u github.com/sonr-io/coins/bitcoin
go get -u github.com/sonr-io/crypto
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Test

To build and test all blockchain modules, use the provided Makefile:

```shell
# Build and test all coins
make

# Build and test a specific coin
make bitcoin
```

The output will display the build status for each chain. If a module fails, the error message will indicate the issue for further debugging.

## üí¨ Feedback and Support

The Sonr Go Wallet SDK is based on the OKX Web3 Go Wallet SDK with enhanced features and optimizations. Each blockchain's specific usage can be found in the corresponding README within the `coins` directory. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please submit them through [GitLab Issues](https://github.com/sonr-io/coins/issues), and we will address them promptly.
